      <p>Interviews are hard, and as a candidate, you are typically given 45-50 minutes to show what you can do. As an interviewer, this is equally as hard to assess if the person is a good fit in such a short amount of time. There are no one-size fits all for interviews, interviewers are typically given an area to cover but apart from that the questions they ask are at their own discretion</p>

      <p>From being on both sides of the table as an interviewee to interviewer myself, this post tries to cover the most important areas of front-end development youâ€™re likely to be asked.</p>
