        <p>
          Interviews are hard, and as a candidate, you are typically given 45-50
          minutes to show what you can do. As an interviewer, this is equally as
          hard to assess if the person is a good fit in such a short amount of
          time. There are no one-size fits all for interviews, interviewers are
          typically given an area to cover but apart from that the questions
          they ask are at their own discretion
        </p>

        <p>
          From being on both sides of the table as an interviewee to interviewer
          myself, this post tries to cover the most important areas of front-end
          development youâ€™re likely to be asked.

          Being a developer or engineer building for the web requires a lot of
          knowledge.Algorithm interviews go beyond just algorithms and data

          Docker is a set of platform as a service products that uses OS-level
          virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own
          software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with
          each other through well-defined channels
